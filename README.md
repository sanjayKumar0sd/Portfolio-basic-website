🌐 Personal Portfolio Website Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built using pure HTML and CSS. This project is a simple yet effective showcase of my web development skills, focusing on clean design, structure, and user-friendly navigation.

🔹 Pages Included: Home – A brief introduction and overview.

Contact – A form for users to reach out to me easily.

Register – A basic registration page to demonstrate form design and structure.

This project reflects my foundation in front-end development and serves as a stepping stone towards more dynamic and interactive websites. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as inspiration for your own projects.
